    <h1> Kobe Bryant</h1>
     <p> Many consider Kobe Bryant to be one of the best to ever play the game of basketball. Winning 5 rings in 17 seasons of playing professional basketball is pretty hard to do. Kobe is a 17 time all star and he also broke michael jordans record in scoring. Kobe has always been the go to player when games are on the line. Though he did not retire a champion he will retire as a legend and will forever be remembered.
